Hey, I'm **Nicholas Murimi** 👋

Java web developer | Python automation addict | Cybersecurity engineer

Currently building secure enterprise systems with Spring Boot & Jakarta EE, automating everything that moves with Python, and hunting bugs/vulnerabilities for fun.

When I'm not coding or pentesting, you'll find me contributing to open source, sharing tools on GitHub, or writing about Java, DevOps, and ethical hacking.

Always open to interesting projects and collaborations — feel free to reach out!
